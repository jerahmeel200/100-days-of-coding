# Day-25 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q73** - Assigning and Updating Variables: Create a function where you declare a variable using let and assign an initial value. Then, update its value within the same function and log both the initial and updated values.


**Q74** - Swapping Variables: Demonstrate how to swap the values of two variables. Start with variables `a = 5` and `b = 10`, then swap their values so that `a` becomes `10` and `b` becomes `5`.
