# Day-24 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q70** - Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.

**Q71** - Compare `let` and `const`: Create two examples where `let` allows reassignment but `const` does not. Try to reassign a `const`-declared variable and catch the error.
