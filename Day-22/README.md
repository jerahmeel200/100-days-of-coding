# Day-22 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Q64** - Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

**Q65** - Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.

**Q65** - Logical AND Verification: Create a function that checks two boolean (true or false) values. It should only say true if both are true, using the && operator. For instance, checkBothTrue(true, false) should be false.
